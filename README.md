# CityGenerator2D

Assignment idea for my 4th year Game Engines moudle.

City will be generated using a set of procedural algorithms that I will design and implement.

Graphical representation of generated data will be displayed as a 2D projection using my own custom game engine [DebEngine](https://gitlab.com/debsonosbed/DebEngine) with a Vulkan renderer.
